<h1>Hello! I'm Viktor Jurčić.</h1>
<h2>Optimistic, straightforward and<br>a perfectionist at heart.</h2>
<p>I am a graduate of the <a href="http://www.inf.uniri.hr/en/">Department of Informatics, University of Rijeka, Croatia</a> where I obtained my <strong>Bachelor's and Master's degree in Business Informatics</strong>.</p>
<p>My Bachelor's thesis focused on the dissection, modification and integration of the White Label template by revaxarts with an e-learning PHP application.</p>
<p>My Master's thesis focused on showcasing the usage of modern web technologies (MongoDB, Node.js, AngularJS and WebGL) and application of the Lean Startup method and Feature Driven Development process on building a photo sharing website and, in more detail, it's virtual gallery module.</p>
<p>My main focus and interest lies in <strong>Web development</strong> and associated technologies. While my languages of choice are JavaScript, PHP and Python, I'm willing to use/learn <em>any</em> language and associated technologies that best suite the problem being worked on.</p>
<p>Your welcome to read on <a href="http://viktor.jurcic.me/#about">about me</a>, the <a href="http://viktor.jurcic.me/#projects">projects I've worked on</a>, or <a href="http://viktor.jurcic.me/#contact">contact me</a>.</p>

<h2 id="about">About me</h2>
<p><a href="http://viktor.jurcic.me/files/Viktor_Jurcic_CV.pdf">Download my CV (PDF)</a></p>
<p>I started programming in 6th grade, primary school. I worked in QBasic and went to a couple of city, regional and one state competition. In middle school I mostly programmed in Visual Basic and used HTML as part of our Informatics class.</p>
<p>In college I directed myself towards Web development. Started with PHP, then Python and then taught myself JavaScript. Also HTML, CSS, MySQL and MongoDB are a part of what I learned and still use.</p>
<p>My main working machine has been running Ubuntu since 2010. I've used Atom, NetBeans, Eclipse, Spyder and the Linux terminal as my work environments.</p>
<p>I like teaching people about open source software. At the Document Freedom Day 2015. event at the Department of Informatics I held a presentation [in Croatian] titled "My experience with transition from MS Office to LibreOffice" in which I also talked about open document formats, mainly OOXML vs. ODF.</p>
<p>In May 2015., I received the <strong>Rector's Award for Excellence</strong> as the best student of the Department of Informatics, University of Rijeka for the academic year 2014./2015., and in October, I received recognition from the municipality of Čavle for contributions in the development of education in 2015.</p>
<p>On September 24, 2015. I have successfully defended my Master's Thesis and obtained a Master's degree in Informatics.</p>

<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
<p><strong>Syphos</strong>, photo sharing system.</p>
<ul>
<li>Master's degree project in which my colleague and I build a simple photo sharing website using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, Node.js) on which we build our specific modules. My module was the 3D Web Virtual gallery intended on showcasing the usage of 3D (WebGL) on the Web.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sleeping disorder research.</p>
<ul>
<li>As the only student enrolled in the "Discovering knowledge in data" class at the Department of Informatics in the academic year 2014./2015., I got the chance to participate in this project. My assignment was the development of a script (in R) for visualizing data on fruit fly activity.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://onetius.com/"><strong>Onetius</strong></a>, e-learning platform.</p>
<ul>
<li>An ambitious project to build an open and free to use educational platform. My assignment was the development and maintenance of the Django REST API and MySQL database.</li>

<li>I left the project due to professional differences.</li>
</ul>
<p>Adventures in the tomb of the mathematicians, educational game.</p>
<ul>
<li>Build for a colleague assignment using the <a href="http://e-adventure.e-ucm.es/">eAdventure platform</a>. The goal of the game is to teach children the basics of triangle trigonometry.</li>
<li>I led a team of 5 people, co-authored the storyline and designed most of the level and character resources.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://github.com/vjurcic/Connect-The-Words">Connect-the-Words</a>, educational game.</p>
