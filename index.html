            About me:
        </h3>

        <p>
            Student at the <a href="http://www.inf.uniri.hr/">Department of Informatics</a>, University of Rijeka with a passion for learning and problem solving.
        </p>

        <p>
            Optimistic, straightforward and a perfectionist at heart.
        </p>

        <p>
            I started programming when I was 11 years old in 6th grade, primary school. Worked in QBasic and went to a couple of city, regional and one state competition. In middle school I mostly programmed in Visual Basic and some HTML as part of our Informatics class. In college I directed myself towards Web development. Started with PHP, then Python, taught myself jQuery and am still working on my JavaScript skills. Also HTML, CSS, AJAX and MySQL are a part of what I learned and still use.
        </p>

        <p>
            My main working machine has been running Ubuntu for the last 4 years. I've used NetBeans, Eclipse, Spyder and the Linux terminal as my work environments.
        </p>

        <p>
            I've participated in <a href="http://whohack.com/event-5-details_whohack-4.html">WhoHack #4</a> with my colleagues from <a href="http://onetius.com/">Onetius</a> where we won 4th place with the online game Barfight (not released). Also participated in Web Summit 2014. as an Alpha exhibitor with the Onetius project.
        </p>

        <p>
            I've left Onetius due to professional differences and to focus on my own projects.
        </p>

        <p>
            Recently done some work in R for a professor of the Department of Informatics who is working on a data mining project. In time I'd like to get into data mining as it looks interesting and useful.
        </p>

        <p>
            As mentioned, I'm currently bettering my JavaScript skills and working with (learning to use) MongoDB, Node and OpenGL (WebGL) and teaching myself proper planning and documenting techniques  while working on my Masters degree project.
