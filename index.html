            About me:
        </h3>

        <p>
            Student at the <a href="http://www.inf.uniri.hr/">Department of Informatics</a>, University of Rijeka with a passion for learning and problem solving.
        </p>

        <p>
            Optimistic, straightforward and a perfectionist at heart.
        </p>

        <p>
            I started programming when I was 11 years old in 6th grade, primary school. Worked in QBasic and went to a couple of city, regional and one state competition. In middle school I mostly programmed in Visual Basic and some HTML as part of our Informatics class. In college I directed myself towards <b>Web development</b>. Started with <b>PHP</b>, then <b>Python</b>, taught myself <b>jQuery</b> and am <unl>still working</unl> on my <b>JavaScript</b> skills. Also HTML, CSS, and SQL are a part of what I learned and still use.
        </p>

        <p>I also have some experience working with Java.</p>
        
        <p>
            My main working machine has been running Ubuntu since 2010. I use NetBeans, Eclipse, Spyder and the Linux terminal as my work environments.
        </p>

        <p>
            I've participated in <a href="http://whohack.com/event-5-details_whohack-4.html">WhoHack #4</a> with my colleagues from <a href="http://onetius.com/">Onetius</a> where we won 4th place with the online game Barfight (<i>not released</i>). Also participated in Web Summit 2014. as an Alpha exhibitor with the Onetius project.
        </p>

        <p>
            I've left Onetius due to professional differences and to focus on my own projects.
        </p>

        <p>
            In 2014. I developed a data visualization script in <b>R</b> for a professor of the Department of Informatics who is working on a data mining project. In time I'd like to get into data mining as it looks interesting and useful.
        </p>

        <p>
            I joined the <a href="http://documentfreedom.org/">Document Freedom Day</a> 2015. event at the Department of Informatics where I held a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YwtY3M7lq0">presentation</a> [<i>in Croatian</i>] titled <i>"My experience with transition from MS Office 2007 to LibreOffice"</i>. I also talked about open document formats, mainly OOXML vs. ODF.
        </p>

        <p>
            As mentioned, I'm currently bettering my JavaScript skills and working with (<span class="unl">learning to use</span>) MongoDB, Node and WebGL and teaching myself proper planning and documenting techniques while working on my Masters degree project.
